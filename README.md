- Update `README.md` with their information
- Create a new folder called `/app`
- Work and make commits as they code to the `/app` folder
- Include a detailed `README.md` in `/app` on how to setup/configure and run the app
- Make their forked repo public accessible
- Submit to code-challenge@tapp.group with in time limit
  - subject line of your name, ‘submission’ and date. For example, "Tommy Tappson -Submission 08-22-2018"
  - body with link to your repo and roughly how long it took you to complete the challenge.

Good luck! Can’t wait to see your awesome code! If you have any questions, ask us at code-challenge@tapptravel.co

## Time Limit

The challenge must be submitted within 72 hours of receiving. The time heavily depends on how feature complete you want to make it. Realistically, you should not spend more than a day.

## User Interface

[Design Mockups](https://github.com/TAPP-Travel/Code-Challenge/tree/master/design)

You can open `/design/index.html` as a local file in your browser to view mockups. Assets are included in `/design/assets`.

The resulting app should have UI that closely resembles the provided design mockups. While it doesn’t have to be pixel perfect, the key relationships and design elements should be implemented.

  - Allowe user to search and add additional places to bookmarks
  - Weather and other non-bookmark information can be mocked
