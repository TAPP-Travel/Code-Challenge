## Time Limit

The challenge must be submitted within 72 hours of receiving. The time heavily depends on how feature complete you want to make it. Realistically, you should not spend more than a day.

## User Interface
[Design Mockups](https://github.com/TAPP-Travel/Code-Challenge/tree/master/design)

You can open `/design/index.html` as a local file in your browser to view mockups. Assets are included in `/design/assets`.

The resulting app should have UI that closely resembles the provided design mockups. While it doesn’t have to be pixel perfect, the key relationships and design elements should be implemented.
